Allows for more controlled quota rollover. For if Quota Rollover starts feeling too easy.

### Features
- Sets up quota rollover to help reduce hoarding
- Adds a percentage penalty for rollover to encourage hoarding a little
- Attempts to balance rollover making the game too easy and front loaded

### Usage
There are three settings available, the base rollover percent, the threshold, and the penalty percent.
The base rollover percent controls how much quota is rolled over in general.
The threshold percent is the percent of the next quota obtained before applying the penalty to the rest of the rollover.
The penalty percent is only applied to the quota above each multiple of the threshold, stacking multiplicatively.

If you want to play vanilla, and just have the color highlights on the quota board, set the base rollover to 0%.

If you want the settings to match Quota Rollover, set the base rollover to 100%, and the threshold to 0% to disable it.

By default, the base is 50%, the threshold is 100%, and the penalty is 50%, which makes it impossible to rollover enough to get the next three days off.
